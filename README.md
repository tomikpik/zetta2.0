# Zetta on steroids
eClub Zetta enters new era

There are two main folders
- **cloudServer**
- **hubServer**

which provides different startup scripts for different location (cloud vs hub).

zetta-runtime is realized as submodule

Next important folder is **esense** which contains:
- **scouts**: should be used to store scouts for each communication channel (mqtt, 868, ble etc.)
- **modules**: should contain our modules which we are going to need (authentication, database etc.)
- **drivers**: drivers for various devices
- **apps**: scripts for "clever" light control

It uses node.js version 5.7.1
